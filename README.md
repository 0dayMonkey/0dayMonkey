<h3><center>On <a href="github.com/0dayMonkey">my profile</a> you will find most of the codes that I write and that I improve over time: this is not a place where you should look for what could help you, this profile is mainly for me display banalities and training and experience codes.</center></h3>

- If you find something that helps you then that's a big pleasure!

<h4>Note : /!\ I didn't keep github up to date: I imported files that I had already written before, I tried to separate the old codes from the new ones!: </h4>
